<html lang="en">  - html opening tab begins here  - ROOT element    - language is english

Elements vs. tags
  Elements
    1. Doctype
    2. html  - opening and closing area
    3. head - provides metadata (title + links to style sheet )
    4. body - everything the user sees
  Tags
  1. <> have the inequality signs - html , body & head, title - need opening <> and closing </> tags
  2. Self closing tage - i.e. <meta> no longer need /> due to HTML 5
    <meta>
    <link>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <input>
    <source>
    <embed>
    <param>
    <wbr>

Nesting tags
- <body> & <head> tags are nested under <html> tag  - html is the parent, head & body are the child - sibilings are   body & head
- <meta> and <title> inside the <head> - head is the ancestor & meta/title are the descendants
